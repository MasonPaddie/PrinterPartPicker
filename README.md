# PrinterPartPicker
## Background
Printer Part Picker is an application based on the website https://pcpartpicker.com/ but for 3D printers in place of PCs. It is common for PC enthusiasts to build PCs from bare components, but this is not the case with 3D printer enthusiasts. Instead, a 3D printers is bought as a "base" printer and parts are bought and exchanged to make custom machines. For this reason, the application is designed to take an initial printer as a base printer and set the initial list of components to that of the selected base printer. 

## Initial Wireframes
The application was planned to have a home page user interface as pictured below. As the project progressed, this design was altered for simplicty, though this is one of the main areas the application could be improved.

In place of having a interactive user interface on the index pages, a unique looking home page was added so that the user could always recenter themselves on a unique looking page.
